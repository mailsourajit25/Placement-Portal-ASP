    <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">
        The Kolkata Institute of Technology is one of the most reputed institutes for technological education and research in India. Known for its strong relations with the industry, the Institute has always been a favourite destination of recruitment for many firms.
    The Training and Placement office is the nodal point of contact for companies seeking to establish a fruitful relationship with KIT. As our logo says, "Siddhirbhavati Karmaja" - Success comes through hard work.

    <h4 style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-weight: bold">Message from Director</h4>
    <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">KIT continues to produce world-class graduates and post graduates year after year. Particularly noteworthy is the increase in the number of post-graduates, both at the Masters’ and Doctoral levels who continue to be immediately absorbed by industry and academia all over the world. Our graduates are an integral part of India’s growth story. The nation's best education system, along with the finest facilities, has ensured that our students achieve excellence in their chosen fields.
        I am certain that our students, with the help of the Placement Office, will find their dream jobs. Equally, I am sure the organizations they join will be glad they came here. I appreciate the Placement Office for their untiring efforts and wish the students all the best in Placement 2015-16.
